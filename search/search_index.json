If you\u2019re fluent in one of these languages but hesitant to learn the other, you\u2019re in the right place. The good news is that there are many similarities between R and Python that make it easy to switch between the two.</p> <p>Both R and Python are widely used in data science and are open-source, meaning that they are free to use and constantly being improved by the community. They both have extensive libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. In fact, many of the libraries in both languages have similar names and functions, such as Pandas in Python and data.table in R.</p> <p>While there are differences between the two languages, they can complement each other well. Python is versatile and scalable, making it ideal for large and complex projects such as web development and artificial intelligence. R, on the other hand, is known for its exceptional statistical capabilities and is often used in data analysis and modeling. Visualization is also easier in R, making it a popular choice for creating graphs and charts.</p> <p>By learning both R and Python, you\u2019ll be able to take advantage of the strengths of each language and create more efficient and robust data analysis workflows.

We then use mutate to create a new column with fuel efficiency in kilometers per liter. Finally, we group the data by the number of cylinders and calculate the mean horsepower and fuel efficiency.</p> <p>Data Wrangling in Python Pandas</p> <p>Pandas is a popular library for data manipulation in Python. It provides a data frame object similar to R\u2019s data frames, along with a wide range of functions for data wrangling.</p> <p>Here is an example of using pandas to filter, transform, and group a data frame:</p> <p>Python code:</p> <pre><code>import pandas as pd\n\n# Load data\nmtcars = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/mtcars.csv')\n\n# Filter for cars with more than 100 horsepower\nfiltered_mtcars = mtcars[mtcars['hp'] &gt; 100]\n\n# Add a new column with fuel efficiency in km per liter\nfiltered_mtcars['kmpl'] = 0.425 * filtered_mtcars['mpg']\n\n# Group by number of cylinders and calculate mean horsepower and fuel efficiency\ngrouped_mtcars = filtered_mtcars.groupby('cyl').agg({'hp': 'mean',\n                                                     'kmpl': 'mean'})\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, we first load the mtcars data from a CSV file. We then filter the data to only include cars with more than 100 horsepower, using boolean indexing. We use the assign function to create a new column with fuel efficiency in kilometers per liter. Finally, we group the data by the number of cylinders and calculate the mean horsepower and fuel efficiency.</p> <p>Comparison</p> <p>Overall, both R\u2019s tidyverse and Python\u2019s pandas provide similar functionality for data wrangling. Both allow for filtering, transforming, and aggregating data frames. The syntax for performing these operations is slightly different between the two languages, with R using the %&gt;% operator for chaining operations and Python using method chaining or the apply family of functions.</p> <p>One key difference between the two languages is that R\u2019s tidyverse provides a consistent grammar for data manipulation across its various packages, making it easier to learn and use. However, Python\u2019s pandas library has a larger developer community and is more versatile for use in other applications, such as web development or machine learning.</p> <p>In conclusion, both R and Python provide powerful tools for data wrangling, and the choice between the two ultimately depends on the specific needs of the user and their familiarity</p>"},{"location":"resources/bilingualism_md/#data-from-api","title":"Data from API","text":"<p>Retrieving data from an API is a common task in both R and Python.

The dataset \u201cCOVID19_race_data.csv\u201d contains COVID-19 race-related data.</p> <p>R: In R, we\u2019ll use the \u2018readr\u2019 and \u2018dplyr\u2019 packages to read, process, and analyze the dataset.</p> <p>R code:</p> <pre><code># Install and load necessary libraries\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Read the CSV file\nurl &lt;- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Data4BlackLives/covid-19/master/data/COVID19_race_data.csv\"\ndata &lt;- read_csv(url)\n\n# Basic information about the dataset\nprint(dim(data))\nprint(head(data))\n\n# Example analysis: calculate the mean of 'cases_total' by 'state'\ndata %&gt;%\n  group_by(state) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean_cases_total = mean(cases_total, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(mean_cases_total))\n</code></pre> <p>Python: In Python, we\u2019ll use the \u2018pandas\u2019 library to read, process, and analyze the dataset.</p> <p>Python code:</p> <pre><code>import pandas as pd\n\n# Read the CSV file\nurl = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Data4BlackLives/covid-19/master/data/COVID19_race_data.csv\"\ndata = pd.read_csv(url)\n\n# Basic information about the dataset\nprint(data.shape)\nprint(data.head())\n\n# Example analysis: calculate the mean of 'cases_total' by 'state'\nmean_cases_total = data.groupby(\"state\")[\"cases_total\"].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)\nprint(mean_cases_total)\n</code></pre> <p>In conclusion, both R and Python provide powerful libraries and tools for downloading, processing, and analyzing datasets, such as those found in the Data for Black Lives repository. The \u2018readr\u2019 and \u2018dplyr\u2019 libraries in R offer a simple and intuitive way to read and manipulate data, while the \u2018pandas\u2019 library in Python offers similar functionality with a different syntax.

For such purposes, we can save data cubes to our local disk as individual netCDF files or as a series of GeoTIFF files. In the case of the latter, each temporal segment of the cube is saved as a separate (multiband) GeoTIFF file.</p> <p>Both netCDF and GeoTIFF formats allow for file size reduction through compression and data packing. This process involves transforming double precision numbers into smaller integer values using a scale and offset, which can be particularly useful for managing disk space (for more details, refer to the ?write_ncdf and ?write_tif documentation).</p> <pre><code>gdalcubes_options(ncdf_compression_level = 1)\nwrite_ncdf(cube, file.path(\"~/Desktop\", basename(tempfile(fileext =
